Hi! Thanks for taking the time to review this. I enjoyed working on this prompt and relished the technical challenges of creating a component from scratch. I chose to complete this challenge in React with Javascript (though I often prefer Typescript, I wasn't sure if it was allowed for this project). For any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me at mipang@seas.upenn.edu!

# Dropdown features

The `<Dropdown />` component contains two props:

1. `items` : the items in your dropdown menu
2. `allowMultiple`: a boolean that signifies whether the dropdown allows multiple selections

I used create-react-app to jumpstart this project. To get started, the dropdown component is located in the `App.js` file. The key files where the bulk of the components are contained in: `Dropdown.js`, `Selector.js`, and `SingleSelector.js`, all under the `src/` folder. The icons are sourced from Font Awesome, and most of the styling is located in `Dropdown.scss`. Hope you enjoy poking around!

To begin this project, navigate to the `dropdown-menu` directory and run
`npm install`
then
`npm start`
